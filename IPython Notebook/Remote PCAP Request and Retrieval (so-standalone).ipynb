    "In this notebook, we will:\n",

    "1. **Load PCAP Request Information**: We'll read a CSV file that contains necessary details about the requests we want to make. This includes source IPs, destination IPs, source ports, and destination ports.\n",
    "2. **Formulate Google Stenographer Requests**: Based on the loaded information, we will craft the specific stenographer request format.\n",
    "3. **Establish and Test an SSH Connection**: Before proceeding with our PCAP operations, we need to ensure that our SSH connection to the remote server is reliable. Thus, we'll try establishing a connection to the specified remote server.\n",
    "4. **Request and Retrieve PCAP Files**: This is the core operation where we'll connect to the remote server, execute our crafted stenographer requests, and then fetch the resultant PCAP files back to our local machine.\n"
